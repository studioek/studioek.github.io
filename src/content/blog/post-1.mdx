# Welcome to my new blog!

This is an example of how **MDX** works. You can write Markdown as usual, but you can also import and use React components directly.

## Using the Highlighter Component

Here is a standard paragraph. But what if we want to highlight something special?

<Highlighter client:visible action="highlight" color="#ffd1dc">
  This text is highlighted using our custom component!
</Highlighter>

We can also do other annotations like:

- <Highlighter client:visible action="box" color="#b3e5fc">
    Boxing text
  </Highlighter>
- <Highlighter client:visible action="circle" color="#c8e6c9">
    Circling text
  </Highlighter>
- <Highlighter client:visible action="underline" color="#ffccbc">
    Underlining text
  </Highlighter>
- <Highlighter client:visible action="strike-through" color="#e1bee7">
    Striking through text
  </Highlighter>

## Syntax Highlighting

Astro's MDX integration comes with Shiki built-in for syntax highlighting.

```javascript
// This is a code block
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```python
# Python code block
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
